### Setup hosts file

Once you get the IP address from the instructor, you need to update the hosts file of your computer.
Hello
The `hosts` file is located in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc

Add the following line, replace the `IP` with the IP address given by your instructor

```
IP mynode
```

### Access to your node via ssh

```bash
ssh azureuser@mynode
```

## Preparation of the microk8s cluster

```bash
sudo snap install microk8s --classic

# Enable dns, ingress and dashboard
sudo microk8s enable dashboard
sudo microk8s enable dns
sudo microk8s enable ingress
sudo microk8s enable hostpath-storage
```

### Install CLI tooling

```bash
sudo apt install jq -qqy
sudo snap install helm --classic
sudo snap install kubectl --classic
```

### Get the kubeconfig file to authenticate to k8s

```bash
mkdir ~/.kube
sudo microk8s config > ~/.kube/config
chmod 400 ~/.kube/config
```

### Get access to the k8s dashboard

```bash
# Edit the service and change the type, instead of ClusterIP replace it with NodePort
kubectl patch svc kubernetes-dashboard --type='json' \
    -p '[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/type","value":"NodePort"},{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/ports/0/nodePort","value":31443}]' \
    -n kube-system
```

Open now the dashboard in the browser:

https://mynode:31443

To get the token you can run the folling command:

```bash
kubectl get secret -n kube-system microk8s-dashboard-token \
    -o json | jq -r .data.token | base64 -d
```

Store the token somewhere else since we will constantly make use of it.
